                    <p class="plan-content">
                        Saxton Hale is a daring Australian, President and CEO of Mann Co., and the star of many comics series.
                        He is considered the fourth richest man in America.
                        He was the sixth richest man in America, but surpassed the fifth by wealth and the fourth by killing him in a harpoon duel.
                    </p>
                    <p class="plan-content">
                        His favorite pastimes include fighting, drinking, and battling with ferocious animals.
                        In fact, most kids sleep with a teddy bear at night, but Saxton Hale sleeps with an actual bear that he tamed while in the Brazilian Jungles.

                    <p class="plan-content">
                        His identifying features include a mustache, rippling muscles, a crocodile-tooth lined hat, and a patch of rotating chest hair shaped like Australia.
                        He also refuses to wear clothes on his upper body "for obvious reasons".

                    <p class="plan-content">
                        Gray Mann is the third son of Zepheniah Mann.
                        The smallest of the three Mann brothers, Gray was also the most intelligent of the three.
                        He could speak perfectly by the time he was born, but was the weakest physically.
                    </p>
                    <p class="plan-content">
                        Disgusted by how he could talk, Zepheniah Mann was going to smother Gray, but before his father could do so, Gray was abducted by a wild eagle; the event taking place during the "Great Eagle Scourge of 1822".
                        The eagle took Gray away from his family, and raised as one of its own.
                    </p>
                    <p class="plan-content">
                        After being raised by his eagle abductor, Gray killed and ate her and her children before crawling back to civilization to build his corporate empire, Gray Gravel Company.
                        According to Zepheniah Mann, in 1849, Gray Mann had threatened to blackmail him for his cache of "miracle" gravel.

                    <p class="plan-content">
                        The Administrator, whose given name is Helen, who was also originally known as Announcer or The Voice because of the character's role as Announcer, manages the affairs of both the RED and BLU companies and their teams of mercenaries, as well as TF Industries.
                    </p>
                    <p class="plan-content">
                        She is the source of the mysterious, disembodied female voice that issues commands and announces vital events during rounds.

                    <p class="plan-content">
                        A mature and thoroughly evil mastermind of a woman, the Administrator possesses both a piercing gaze and the sort of voice that commands total and unwavering obedience... or else.
                        Her general demeanor tends towards either slight anger or various stages of bitter disappointment.

                        F. Pauling, known to everyone as Miss Pauling, is a loyal assistant to the Administrator.
                        She performs a number of duties including reporting unusual background checks, ordering and delivery of goods, opening communication channels and murders.
                    </p>
                    <p class="plan-content">
                        Miss Pauling generally complies with her employer's views for fear of incurring her wrath, even if she does not necessarily agree with them.
                        Despite her boss's stern demeanor, Miss Pauling insists the Administrator is "not so bad when you get to know her".

                    <p class="plan-content">
                        When pressed by the Administrator on what exactly friends do, her reply was "Um. Go skating... look at gun catalogs... sometimes we just talk...".
